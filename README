either_ptr<A,B> is type similar to boost::variant<A*,B*> in concept. It differs
in few ways:
- it is always the same size as void*
- it allows for A to be the same type as B
- it can only store types with alignment of at least 2. To be precise it
  requires passed pointer to have lowest bit set to zero.

To use it's enough to copy either_ptr.hpp and LICENSE files to your project.
